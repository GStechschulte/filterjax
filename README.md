# filterjax
Bayesian filters and smoothers in JAX.

filterjax is a Python library for Bayesian filtering and smoothing in JAX. It is inspired by [filterpy](https://github.com/rlabbe/filterpy) and [Dynamax](https://github.com/probml/dynamax). filterjax is still in early development and is primarily intended to learn JAX, how to set up a Python package directory, generate documentation with Sphinx, and how to automate testing (using `pytest`) with GitHub Actions.
