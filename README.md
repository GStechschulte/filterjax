# filterjax
Bayesian filters and smoothers in JAX.

filterjax is a Python library for Bayesian filtering and smoothing in JAX. It is inspired by [filterpy](https://github.com/rlabbe/filterpy). filterjax is still in early development and is primarily intended to learn JAX, and how to set up and deploy a Python package with `pytest` and GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and automated documentation with Sphinx.
